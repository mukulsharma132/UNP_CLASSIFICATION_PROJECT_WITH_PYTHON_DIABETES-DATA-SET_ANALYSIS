# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_DIABETES-DATA-SET_ANALYSIS
During my internship at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Machine Learning Classification Model using Python to predict outcomes from the dataset. I cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing variables. Several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest, were implemented and compared to find the best-performing model. The project involved EDA, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, enhancing my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and performance analysis.
